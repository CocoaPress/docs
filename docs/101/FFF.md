# Fused Food Fabrication and You

FFF, or [Fused Filament Fabrication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication), is typically the category of addictive manufacturing where some material is extruded through some nozzle and moved to produce a design in 3-dimensional space.  This typically refers to plastic 3D printers, but in our case, is that of fused *food* fabrication.

## Overhangs

FFF can enable some incredible designs that wouldn't be possible with any other method of manufacture, especially for chocolate.  A common chocolate-making technique is to use molds, where the profile of a piece is taken and then filled or poured with molten chocolate.

Compared to the timeless "Benchy" test print for 3d printing, and any piece of interior detail, would be unattainable with molding.

## Support

<!-- TODO replace example with Thangs links. -->
As a user, you can use support structure, where chocolate is used as scaffolding for the rest of your print, to support large overhangs.  As chocolate cools, it doesn't instantly solidify, so this is an important step for most FFF printers as well.  Alternatively, you might be able to just look at [models]() that already have support built-in, or better yet, don't need it at all.

An example of a print that expects support might be [this] model of X, where a print that doesn't need it (especially if some small overhangs and drooping is acceptable) might be Y.
