# Fused Food Fabrication and You

FFF, or [Fused Filament Fabrication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication), is typically the category of addictive manufacturing where some material is extruded through some nozzle and moved to produce a design in 3-dimensional space.  This typically refers to plastic 3D printers, but in our case, is that of fused *food* fabrication.

The Cocoa Press works similarly to plastic printers in theory, the extruder is moved around the workspace of the printer, extruding warm material (chocolate) and cooling through ambient temperatures to produce novel and interesting designs!

## Overhangs

FFF can enable some incredible designs that wouldn't be possible with any other method of manufacturing, especially for chocolate. 

A common chocolate-making technique is to use molds, where the profile of a piece is taken and then filled or poured with molten chocolate.  

Compared to the timeless ["Benchy"](https://www.3dbenchy.com/) test print for 3d printing, and any piece of interior detail, would be unattainable with molding.

These techniques can even be combined like below, where the interior of this bon-bon was printed, and the shell was molded to produce an incredibly unique bonbon!

## Support

As a user, you can use support structure, where chocolate is used as scaffolding for the rest of your print, to support large overhangs.  As chocolate cools, it doesn't instantly solidify, so this is an important step for most FFF printers as well.  Alternatively, you might be able to just look at models that already have support built-in, or better yet, don't need it at all.  Some parts of the Cocoa Press are actually printed with integral supports.

An example of a print that expects support might be the [extruder cover piece](https://github.com/CocoaPress/PrintedParts/blob/main/STLs/XY%20Gantry/X%20Gantry/Extruder/extruder_shell_front.stl), where a print that doesn't need it (especially if some small overhangs and drooping is acceptable) might be the [Benchy](https://www.3dbenchy.com/), where depending on a wide variety of factors, can effect the output quality.

!!! info
    The content in green in the above screenshot are "organic" supports, a newer style that uses less material for other forms of FFF printing. The parts in orange and blue are the actual material used for the print in question.
