# Chocolate Ethics

Each Cocoa Core you get has a shelf life of one year from the manufacturing date, as well as made with sustainably sourced palm oil certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil.  Additionally, our cores are also Certified Kosher Dairy by the Chicago Rabbinical Council.  

Our supply partners are committed to ethical and sustainable cocoa harvesting, farming, and working towards carbon neutrality and other ethics-oriented goals.

Our Cocoa Cores are *not* Vegan, but we're working with our partners to get a vegan white cocoa core blend just right.  Unfortunately it's not ready yet.
