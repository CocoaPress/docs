### Bloom

Over time, most chocolates form "bloom" when exposed to air.  Some form a "fat bloom", where the fat crystals destabilize or change, and some form a "sugar bloom", where the sugar crystals react with moisture.  Many factors can contribute to bloom, but bloom is still safe to eat. <!-- citations needed -->
