# Storing Chocolate

To store your chocolate compound cores for use with your printer safely and easily, you'll want to store it between 60-75F (16-24C), and below 65% relative humidity.

Storage above this point may result in bloom forming on the chocolate.

### Bloom

Over time, most chocolates form "bloom" when exposed to air.  Some form a "fat bloom", where the fat crystals destabilize or change, and some form a "sugar bloom", where the sugar crystals react with moisture.  Many factors can contribute to bloom, but bloom is still safe to eat.
