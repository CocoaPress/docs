## Needed Tools

- [ ] Tube Brush
- [ ]  Soap
- [ ] Warm Water
- [ ] Pushrod

<!-- todo, get photos of all tools laid out. -->

## Prep

- [ ] Unscrew the nozzle from the housing
- [ ] Use pushrod to remove plunger if still present

## Cleaning

- [ ] Apply soap to tube brush and clean inside of housing with warm water.
    - [ ] Placement under faucet of the brush when not in tube allows each cycle to remove chocolate and allows warm water to dislodge any remaining.
- [ ] Using the tube brush, clean threads of the housing and ensure there’s no chocolate stuck in threads.
- [ ] Using the flat brush, clean up anything left in the nozzle and run under warm water.  Most should be removable with this brush.
- [ ] Using the tube brush’s edge, clean the bottom face of the nozzle, including the tip.

## Drying

- [ ] Pat dry
- [ ] Allow to air dry completely before use

## Before Use

- [ ] Check once more for droplets of water.  None should be present, and if so, should not be immediately used.
- [ ] Re-thread nozzle and body to ensure good connection.
