# Plunger Health and Cleaning

The plunger is a mechanically important part of your Cocoa Press. Responsible for both compressing the liquedous compound chocolate, and allowing air to escape past the top, it's a core part of keeping your fused food fabrication prints edible and safe.

However, these parts are *wear* parts, and will need to be replaced over time.
