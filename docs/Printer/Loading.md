# Loading Chocolate

To load chocolate into your Cocoa Press, you'll need to follow the steps below for best print results.

!!! warning
    This guide assumes that you've already cleaned your cartridges following [this guide](Cleaning.md).  Please do so before attempting to load chocolate, as failure to properly clean your cartridge may cause prints to fail in exceedingly high rates.

## Prep
 - [ ] Wash your hands before handling food-contact components.


## Loading
 - [ ] Insert Cocoa Core into cartridge body via the top opening.

!!! note
    Ensure the firmware version you're on is up to date if using white chocolate. Those temperatures may change over time as we dial in our settings.

## Done!

You're now ready to print your next amazing creation!

## Unloading

In your kit is also provided a delrin push-rod, to make removing the plungers easier should they become stuck inside a cartridge.  Simply unscrew the nozzle and use the push rod to firmly eject the cartridge before washing thoroughly.
