# Loading Chocolate

To load chocolate into your Cocoa Press, you'll need to follow the steps below for best print results.

!!! warning
    This guide assumes that you've already cleaned your cartridges following [this guide](Cleaning.md).  Please do so before attempting to load chocolate, as failure to properly clean your cartridge may cause prints to fail in exceedingly high rates.

## Prep
 - [ ] Wash your hands before handling food-contact components.


## Loading
 - [ ] Insert chocolate core into cartridge body via the top opening.

 - [ ] Use the thumb screw to secure the cartridge in place. <!-- use photo of thumbscrew to show "correct" orientation; glamour shot possibility.-->
 - [ ] Using the Load / Unload menu, lower the leadscrew until the motor stalls.
    - [ ] This step removes air from the cartridge and ensures print uniformity.

## Print Prep
 - [ ] Tilt the extruder back vertical, and secure with latch.

!!! note
    Ensure the firmware version you're on is up to date if using white chocolate. Those temperatures may change over time as we dial in our settings.

 - [ ] Once timer expires, press and hold "Extrude" on main menu to gently push chocolate out.
