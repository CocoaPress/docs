# Setting Up PrusaSlicer

## Configuration Wizard

Once PrusaSlicer has been installed, you'll need to go to the Configuration Wizard to add your Cocoa Press.  It should open automatically when you launch the slicer for the first time.  If not, it can be started by opening the "Configuration" menu and pressing "Configuration Wizard".

Select the Cocoa Press machines with the nozzle diameters you have.

!!! info
    PrusaSlicer views different nozzle sizes as different "machines" due to configuration differences.  Select the appropriate nozzle diameters you might use regardless of how many physical printers you have.

Validate that your printer profiles include a "filament type" of "CHOCOLATE'.

It's *highly suggested* that PrusaSlicer's automatic configuration updates and application updates are enabled to ensure you get the latest Cocoa Press machine settings.
