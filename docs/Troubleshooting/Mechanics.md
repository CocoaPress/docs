# Frame & Mechanical Troubleshooting

## Extruder Making Noise

It's fairly common for the extruder to skip steps (or make noise where the motor can't deliver enough energy to overcome friction) when loading chocolate. It's possible your cartridge has a clogged nozzle and may need to be fixed using an [unclogger.](#) <!-- TODO add store link to cleaning kit -->

## Bed Looks Slanted

If your printer's bed looks slanted when looking at it head on, but the printer can successfully probe the meshing area, use the `View Mesh` button to inspect the major differences between corners. 

<!-- TODO add photo of "view mesh"b utton -->

The maximum we'd suggest is about 3mm, and if your printer exceeds this, it's highly suggested you perform the initial assembly steps in the [Assembly Manua] where the bed screws are adjusted.

<!-- TODO add photo of warped bed supports vs good ones -->

Furthering this, you may also need to inspect and potentially re-print the plastic pieces supporting the bed, as warping in this area can signficantly effect the bed leveling.

## Wobbly or Loose Frame

In the event of major movement or vibration, your printer's fasteners may loosen over time.  Tightening these again like done during initial setup should help with this.

## Printer Rocks During Printing

It's possible the rubber feet on the printer may have become dislodged during printing.  Replacing the missing foot or producing a leveling shim may resolve the issue temporarily.

If all rubber feet are present, inspecting that the printed pieces aren't warped and that the frame itself is level and square is a useful mitigation.
