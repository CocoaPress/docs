# Common Issues

## My nozzle clogs often!

It's possible the stock temperatures are too cold for your environment.  This is especially true for seasonal swings.  It's suggested you print a "known good" model and increment the body and nozzle temperature by .1 after giving it time to more evenly distribute the heat.  To make your life easier, you can also set these in your [Slicer Profile](../Advanced/Slicer.md#custom-settings)

Also be sure to use the [Cleaning Tools Kit](https://cocoapress.com/products/cleaning-tools) to ensure there's no blockages from repeatedly heating and cooling a Cocoa Core without purging that material.
