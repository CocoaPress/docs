# Extrusion & Printing Troubleshooting

## First Layer Height Issues

To ensure a consistent and reliable first layer with your Cocoa Press, you'll need to ensure your Z probe is mounted ridigly via the two M3 screws, and that your extruder doesn't wobble during normal operation.

You'll also need to ensure that your printer has probed the print bed for consistently and leveling.  

### Probe Mesh Area

This can be checked in the menu under Menu -> Mesh Leveling -> Probe Mesh.

The printer will take about three minutes and probe the printable area of the bed.  If this step collides with anything, you may need to contact support to work you through resolving this issue.

### Z-Offset

If probing completes successfully, you'll need a sheet of plain printer paper to adjust the Z-offset.  Using the Menu -> Probe Z Offset.  Follow the steps on screen to adjust the spacing between your nozzle and bed for a consistent first layer.

Your paper should slide under the nozzle with a small amount of resistance, but not enough to tear or catch. This will ensure the nozzle can skim the top surface of the silicone baking sheet would damaging it, and keeping the first layer consistent.
