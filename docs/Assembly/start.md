# Before You Begin

Before you start assembling your Cocoa Press, we suggest the minimum avalible to you to make your assembly easier.

## Space

You'll want approximately one eight foot table of space to hold all the parts and tools as you unpack, assemble, and continue on the printer's frame.

## Time

Your printer assembly will take approximately *10-12* hours.  It's heavily suggested you be thorough, take your time, and keep at it.  It'll go by faster than you think.

## Tools

There are some tools you'll need that aren't included in your Cocoa Press Kit to fully assemble it.

- Wire Cutters (for trimming zip ties)
- Soldering Iron (to insert your heat-seat inserts)
    - Your kit comes with a heat-set tool capable of fitting M2 and M3 inserts. Test-fit the tool to your soldering iron before beginning assembly.  
    - In the event your soldering iron doesn't work, [this](https://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-Temperature-Controlled-Thermostatic-Electronic/dp/B089SKWMPT/) is a known working one compatible with the one provided.

### Heatset Technique

When using your heat-set tool, take care to ensure the heatsets are inserted parallel to their final location to minimize drift.

Additionally, some tools may collide with the printed parts; take care to not melt them.

For a video demonstrating how to heatset your printed parts, please see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/C2rznl1uIuc">here.</a>

## Patience

This is the first time this printer has been assembled by *you*.  There may be parts that aren't quite right yet, or aren't clear.  

Don't hesitate to reach out at <a href="mailto:hello@cocoapress.com">hello@cocoapress.com</a> so that we can correct any mistakes and clarify the documentation for both you, and for others.
